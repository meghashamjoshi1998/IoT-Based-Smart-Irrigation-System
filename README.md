# IoT-Based-Smart-Irrigation-System
Here we have build a IoT based Irrigation System using ESP8266 NodeMCU Module and DHT11 Sensor. It will not only automatically irrigate the water based on the moisture level in the soil but also send the data to a dedicated server to keep track of the land condition.
