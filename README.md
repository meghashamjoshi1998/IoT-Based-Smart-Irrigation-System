# IoT-Based-Smart-Irrigation-System
Here we have build a IoT based Irrigation System using ESP8266 NodeMCU Module and DHT11 Sensor. It will not only automatically irrigate the water based on the moisture level in the soil but also send the data to a dedicated server to keep track of the land condition. 

COMPONENTS:
  1. ESP8266 WiFi module
  2. 12V dual channel Relay
  3. DC-DC Buck converter
  4. YL-38 moisture meter (soil moisture sensor)
  5. DHT-22 sensor (Digital Humidity and Temperature sensor)
  6. Solenoid valve
  7. CD74HC4067 16:1 Analog Digital Multiplexer
